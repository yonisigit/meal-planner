# MealFlow  
Select the guests, see their preferences, and let the menu almost choose itself

People love hosting and sharing meals, but coordinating who’s coming, what everyone can eat, and which dishes to serve often becomes stressful and disorganized. This app was created to make meal planning simple and enjoyable — helping hosts easily manage guests and choose the most loved dishes based on everyone’s rankings. By turning the chaos of planning into a smooth, data-driven experience, it lets people focus less on logistics and more on enjoying good food and good company.
